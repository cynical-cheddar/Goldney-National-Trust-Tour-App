## The Proposal

This is an exciting opportunity to work with the University Estates Department to develop a mobile app to bring the gardens and grotto at Goldney Hall to life for visitors.

The University is keen to encourage the public to experience its many historical buildings and grounds and this project will act as a pilot to investigate through a smart phone or tablet. The team will work closely with the estates team, who will provide access to the garden, grotto and to historical content. As an example, estates are especially interested in incorporating an element which will allow disabled visitors to appreciate the grotto, which they are not able to access. The project will include implementing a robust application, user interface, location-aware technology, such as QR codes and/or GPS, back-end server and use of augmented reality tools (ARcore). Design and specification will be drawn up by the team in consultation with estates, so there is plenty of scope for creativity and innovative thinking. An excellent opportunity for gaining experience in developing a mobile, location-aware application and using the latest augmented reality technology

**Problem opportunity |** Outdated visitor infrastructure and obsolete facilities have caused the historic secrets of the Goldney Hall heritage site to be locked away from the public. Although human lead tours are occasionally given, these are hindered through a cap in the group size, pace of tours and inflexibility in bespoke areas of interest. As a result, an opportunity to remove these limitations through technological development has been identified.

**Approach |** Over a 24-week timeframe, we adopted agile principles, by iterating through cycles of design, development and feedback/testing to systematically deploy 3 versions of our solution, namely a minimal viable product, beta release and final release, each fulfilling unique requirements for different stakeholders. We wanted to utilise our client’s extensive knowledge to our advantage and therefore scheduled in a fortnightly client meeting to discuss our progress and welcome their feedback. We aimed to always have a working prototype ready to show our clients to ensure that feedback and testing were at the forefront of the project’s drive.

**Our Solution |** From the introduction of working with History students halfway through the project, this generated the idea of creating two front-ends, one to allow these History students to provide us with the description and image data (a web-platform) and the other to display this information to visitors (an app-based platform). The primary front-end solution is an interactive android application, allowing users to access educational texts, stories, and videos via tagged QR codes located around the garden via their phone where tour features have been added via the secondary web-based platform. A change in design made us realise that the solution we were designing could be easily extended to other estates managed by our clients, and that it therefore held large potential for future upscaling.

From this project, we learnt that although a project can begin with a vivid design for the solution, the development and compromise between the client requirements and what is technologically feasible, actually resulted in a design that can be implemented at a larger scale than was initially anticipated.
